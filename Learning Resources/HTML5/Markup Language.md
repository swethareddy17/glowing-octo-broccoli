# What is a Markup Language?

A **markup language** is a computer language used to define the structure, presentation, and formatting of text within a document.  
It uses a set of **tags** or **symbols** to annotate text, instructing how content should be displayed or interpreted, without being part of the actual text content.

## Key Characteristics

- **Human-readable**: The text can often be read and edited directly without special tools.  
- **Tag-based syntax**: Uses start and end tags (like `<p>...</p>`) to mark up content.  
- **Descriptive, not procedural**: It *describes* data rather than telling the computer how to process it.  
- **Platform-independent**: Works across different systems and applications.
